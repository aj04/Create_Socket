For Implementing TCP Socket :

- Created a java class Client which would take arguements from the script client as Port No, Host_Name , Neu_id

- Created a socket with the given details.

- Send the Hello Message and received the arithmetic question and solved it uptill I received the Secret Flag


For implementing SSL :

- Created a trust manager that does not validate certificate chains by overriding Validating functions with Null or true for All instances.

-Installed all-trusting trust manager which we created above.

-Created an ssl socket factory with our all-trusting manager and set the connection object to use our socket factory which bypasses security checks.

- Send Hello message and keeping interacting untill Secret key has been retrieved.
